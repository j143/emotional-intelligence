# Resilience and Relationships

Calmness and strength when faced with difficulty is an important characteristic. We face difficulties around workplace, at home, relationships, or bureaucracy.

Resilience is an approach to the difficulty in an objective, focused, and open manner. This skill can be learned with practice and transferable to other aspects of life.
