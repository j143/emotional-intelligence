# New Morning Routine

## Do not use morning alarm

If you feel generally sad about the morning alarm sound. Then consider not using alarm. If you sleep early enough, you can wake up on time. Try experimenting with this on holidays. And push it in the working days incrementally.

Early morning alarm will spoil your mood. Reserve alarm for the special occasions but for the daily use trust your biological clock. I decided not to use alarm from the last 8 years. I feel fine now.

I am naturally forgetful but that didn't deter me from attending early morning exams, classes or work. I just wake up after 8 hours of sleep.

If I feel that I would like to sleep a bit further I do not feel guilty about it. If the day allow I will make room for 1 to 2 hours of extended sleep.


Happy sleep.

## Do not make bed first thing in morning

People generally assume we need to make bed immediately after we wake up. But, we should wait while before we do that. Here are the reasons:

1. Bedsheet and blankets get wet with body sweat. They need to left on the bed for a while to dry. Then you can fold all you want
2. Immediately after waking up body will be changed from sleeping to waking mode. So, allow the  body to actually wake up before doing a an activity i.e., making bed sheets.

Listen to the body. Do not be too much carried away with the notion that discipline and bed making are related.
