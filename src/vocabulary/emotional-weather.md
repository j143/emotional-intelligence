The  same applies to our emotions

Emotions are a set of conditions or a state, that have an impact on thought process, physical feeling, energy levels, sense of self, confidence (our position in the environment).

### Cycle

The emotional weather cycle can be in hours and may not be regular/irregular based on our activities.

While, the atmospheric weather will have a cycle of few months, with a daily localized changes.

### What are our elements

Water (75% of the body composition), air, food, external (health, human influence, environmental influence). The elements, in a state of flux, defines weather.

Since the above elements vary so does our emotional weather.
