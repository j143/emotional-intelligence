# Que sera sera

After learning how to use a tool, and different options of it - I feel like I know a lot about everything related to it.

Especially, when I am using the incognito browser as if I am hidden from the internet while the reality is that web addresses that I enter is like a open book that people can intercept.

## Examples

> We definitely do have control over our personal life, but to what extent and with what kind of effort? - is to be considered.

### Personal life

Friends - Our friends do what they think they want to do, they chose to be with us vice versa. Don't I have a thinking at times that our friends are influenced a lot by us.

Body - We can with effort do change. Over the internet we do see a number, of 1 in 1000s of people,  of examples. This gives us an thought that we have control over body with food, and other efforts sometimes.

### Work

Often our span of control is within the confines of the job description. If we are a data engineer with a managerial position our span of control would most likely be up to 5 people. But, there are a lot of departments even for the charismatic personality to influence. I do feel like I have more control over the so many things, we do if we ask people the desk we need and the timings etc. Many people don't ask, right?

### Political

Yes, we have control. But, 1 in population of a country i.e., 1:1000 000 000.

### Cricket

Yes, we have control. How, (the ticket price) / (total cost of hosting the match + pay to various parties).

## So what now

### Circle of competence

The circle in which we have better control.

* If we are a bridge designer, in the design phase of the project we can design and deliver drawings
* A highway designer, ability to shape a city transport and map to an extent. Which could further influence the land improvement along.

Other than the circle of competence, it is Que sera sera.&#x20;
